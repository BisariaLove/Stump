Technical Questions - If you do not know ruby, feel free to use psuedo code or the language of your choice for questions 2 and 3 

1. Suppose there is a table in a mysql database called "listings" with the following schema

	 column :id, :int
	 column :name, :string
	 column :city, :string
	 column :state, :string
	 column :zip, :int
	 column :category, :string

1a. Write a sql statement to query the table for all entries in the table where the category is "Book Stores", the city is Glendale and the state is "CA".

2. Suppose you have access to a ruby object in irb (interactive ruby shell) called @book_stores.  This object is an array of hashes where each hash contains information about a book store.  In total there are n number of hashes in the @book_stores array.

Ex:
$irb>p @book_stores  
@book_stores = [
{ 
 :id       => id1 
 :name => "book_store1",
 :city     => "city1",
 :state  => "state1",
 :zip      => zip1,
 :category => "Book Stores"
},
{
 :id       => id2 
 :name => "book_store2",
 :city     => "city2",
 :state  => "state2",
 :zip      => zip2,
 :category => "Book Stores"
},
...
{
 :id       => idn 
 :name => "book_storen",
 :city     => "cityn",
 :state  => "staten",
 :zip      => zipn,
 :category => "Book Stores"
}
]
$irb>

2a. write a simple ruby method that takes the @book_stores object as input, and prints the name of each store on a newline.  

Ex:
$irb>def print_name( book_stores ) { some ruby code }
$irb>print_name(@book_stores)
book_store1
book_store2
...
book_storen
$irb>

2b. Write an automated test to verify this method works.  Assume invalid input is not supported.
2c. Write an automated test to verify that any @book_stores object does not contain any duplicate book store names
